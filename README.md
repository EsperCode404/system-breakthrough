"Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment. This System is the architect of that bridge."

🧬 Project Overview
Quest System: Breakthrough is a high-immersion, gamified discipline dashboard designed to replace passive to-do lists with a high-stakes "System" environment. Built for the Player who seeks to strengthen both body and mind, it utilizes a custom biometric-style interface and rigid temporal logic to enforce consistency.

⚡ Key Features
Neural Link Sync: A secure, hold-to-sync boot sequence requiring a biometric fingerprint hold to access the HUD.

Temporal Penalty Logic: A high-stakes countdown timer that triggers a Rank E penalty if objectives are not completed by 10:00 PM.

Automated Evaluation: An end-of-day ranking system (S to E) based on objective completion rates.

Identity Persistent HUD: Features the "Neko" sigil, representing focus and neural connectivity.

Anti-Distraction Interface: Zero text-selection protocols and mobile-optimized touch handling to ensure total immersion.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Core: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla JavaScript.

Styling: Custom CSS Custom Properties (Variables), Backdrop Filters, Keyframe Animations.

Typography: Orbitron (Digital HUD Aesthetic).

🎮 How to Play
Sync: Hold the Neko Sigil to initialize the Neural Link.

Define: Enter your daily objectives in the Quest Panel.

Execute: Complete tasks before the Time Until Penalty hits zero.

Ascend: Receive your Rank at 10:00 PM and prepare for the next cycle.

🛡️ The System's Creed
This system does not sugar-coat. It does not accept excuses. It tracks mental strength, discipline, and identity building. If you stall, the System will call it out. If you succeed, the System will acknowledge your evolution.

"The only variable is you."
